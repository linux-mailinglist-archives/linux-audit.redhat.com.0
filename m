When we first spoke the concepts weren't fully formulated, at least to
me.

True, IMA was originally limited to measurement and attestation, but
most of the original EVM concepts were subsequently included in IMA. 
(Remember, Reiner Sailer wrote the original IMA, which I inherited.  I
was originially working on EVM code integrity.)  From a naming
perspective including EVM code integrity in IMA was a mistake.  My
thinking at the time was that as IMA was already calculating the file
hash, instead of re-calculating the file hash for integrity, calculate
the file hash once and re-use it for multiple things - measurement, 
integrity, and audit.   At the same time define a single system wide
policy.

When we first started working on IMA, EVM, trusted, and encrypted keys,
the general kernel community didn't see a need for any of it.  Thus, a
lot of what was accomplished has been accomplished without the backing
of the real core filesystem people.

If block layer integrity was enough, there wouldn't have been a need
for fs-verity.   Even fs-verity is limited to read only filesystems,
which makes validating file integrity so much easier.  From the
beginning, we've said that fs-verity signatures should be included in
the measurement list.  (I thought someone signed on to add that support
to IMA, but have not yet seen anything.)

Going forward I see a lot of what we've accomplished being incorporated
into the filesystems.  When IMA will be limited to defining a system
wide policy, I'll have completed my job.
