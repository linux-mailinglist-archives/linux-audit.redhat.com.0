I'm not sure what you are proving here. Obviously this has to work
in order for a client to reconstruct the file's Merkle tree given
only R and the file content.

It's the construction of the tree and verification of the hashes that
are potentially expensive. The point of caching intermediate hashes
is so that the client verifies them as few times as possible.  I
don't see value in caching those hashes on an untrusted server --
the client will have to reverify them anyway, and there will be no
savings.

Cache once, as close as you can to where the data will be used.

Agreed.

My point is there is a difference between a trusted cache and an
untrusted cache. I argue there is not much value in a cache where
the hashes have to be verified again.

Fair enough.
