Well, I see the NFS problem as being chunk at a time, right, which is
merkle tree, or is there a different chunk at a time mechanism we want
to use?  IMA currently verifies signature on open/exec and then
controls updates.  Since for NFS we only control the client, we can't
do that on an NFS server, so we really do need verification at read
time ... unless we're threading IMA back to the NFS server?

The fs-verity use case is a bit of a crippled one because it's
immutable.  I think NFS represents more the general case where you
can't rely on immutability and have to verify at chunk read time.  If
we get chunk at a time working for NFS, it should work also for fs-
verity and we wouldn't need to have two special paths.

I think, even for NFS we would only really need to log the open, so
same as you imagine for fs-verity.  As long as the chunk read hashes
match, we can be silent because everything is going OK, so we only need
to determine what to do and log on mismatch (which isn't expected to
happen for fs-verity).

Right, I mentioned that in my options ... we need some "supply
integrity" hook ... or possibly multiple hooks for a variety of
possible methods.
