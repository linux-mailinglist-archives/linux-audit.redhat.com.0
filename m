I think, before this, we can help with the basics (and perhaps we
should sort them out before we start documenting what we'll do).  The
first basic is that a merkle tree allows unit at a time verification. 
First of all we should agree on the unit.  Since we always fault a page
at a time, I think our merkle tree unit should be a page not a block. 
Next, we should agree where the check gates for the per page accesses
should be ... definitely somewhere in readpage, I suspect and finally
we should agree how the merkle tree is presented at the gate.  I think
there are three ways:

   1. Ahead of time transfer:  The merkle tree is transferred and verified
      at some time before the accesses begin, so we already have a
      verified copy and can compare against the lower leaf.
   2. Async transfer:  We provide an async mechanism to transfer the
      necessary components, so when presented with a unit, we check the
      log n components required to get to the root
   3. The protocol actually provides the capability of 2 (like the SCSI
      DIF/DIX), so to IMA all the pieces get presented instead of IMA
      having to manage the tree

There are also a load of minor things like how we get the head hash,
which must be presented and verified ahead of time for each of the
above 3.
