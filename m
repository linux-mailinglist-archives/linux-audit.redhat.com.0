Roughly.

When IMA metadata happens to be stored in local filesystems in
a trusted xattr, it's going to enjoy the protection you describe
without needing the addition of a cryptographic signature.

However, that metadata doesn't live its whole life there. It
can reside in a tar file, it can cross a network, it can live
on a back-up tape. I think we agree that any time that metadata
is in transit or at rest outside of a Linux local filesystem, it
is exposed.

Thus I'm interested in a metadata protection mechanism that does
not rely on the security characteristics of a particular storage
container. For me, a cryptographic signature fits that bill
nicely.

When an NFS server lies about mtime and ctime, then NFS is completely
broken. Untrusted NFS server doesn't mean "broken behavior" -- I
would think that local filesystems will have the same problem if
they can't trust a local block device to store filesystem metadata
like indirect blocks and timestamps.

It's not clear to me that IMA as currently implemented can protect
against broken storage devices or incorrect filesystem behavior.

That's fine until we claim that remote filesystems require one form of
metadata and local filesystems use some other form.

To guarantee an unbroken chain of provenance, everyone has to use the
same portable metadata format that is signed once by the content creator.
That's essentially why I believe the Merkle-based metadata format must
require that the tree root is signed.
