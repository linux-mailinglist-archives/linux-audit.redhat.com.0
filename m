Thanks for the help! I just want to emphasize that documentation
(eg, a specification) will be critical for remote filesystems.

If any of this is to be supported by a remote filesystem, then we
need an unencumbered description of the new metadata format rather
than code. GPL-encumbered formats cannot be contributed to the NFS
standard, and are probably difficult for other filesystems that are
not Linux-native, like SMB, as well.

Remote filesystems will need to agree that the size of that unit is
the same everywhere, or the unit size could be stored in the per-file
metadata.

A Merkle tree is potentially large enough that it cannot be stored in
an extended attribute. In addition, an extended attribute is not a
byte stream that you can seek into or read small parts of, it is
retrieved in a single shot.

For this reason, the idea was to save only the signature of the tree's
root on durable storage. The client would retrieve that signature
possibly at open time, and reconstruct the tree at that time.

Or the tree could be partially constructed on-demand at the time each
unit is to be checked (say, as part of 2. above).

The client would have to reconstruct that tree again if memory pressure
caused some or all of the tree to be evicted, so perhaps an on-demand
mechanism is preferable.

Also, changes to a file's content and its tree signature are not
atomic. If a file is mutable, then there is the period between when
the file content has changed and when the signature is updated.
Some discussion of how a client is to behave in those situations will
be necessary.
