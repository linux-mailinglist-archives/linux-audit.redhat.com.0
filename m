IETF contributions occur under a BSD-style license incompatible
with the GPL.

https://trustee.ietf.org/trust-legal-provisions.html

Non-Linux implementers (of OEM storage devices) rely on such standards
processes to indemnify them against licensing claims.

Today, there is no specification for existing IMA metadata formats,
there is only code. My lawyer tells me that because the code that
implements these formats is under GPL, the formats themselves cannot
be contributed to, say, the IETF without express permission from the
authors of that code. There are a lot of authors of the Linux IMA
code, so this is proving to be an impediment to contribution. That
blocks the ability to provide a fully-specified NFS protocol
extension to support IMA metadata formats.

That technology transfer can happen only if all the authors of that
prototype agree to contribute to a standard. That's much easier if
that agreement comes before an implementation is done. The current
IMA code base is more than a decade old, and there are more than a
hundred authors who have contributed to that base.

Thus IMO we want an unencumbered description of any IMA metadata
format that is to be contributed to an open standards body (as it
would have to be to extend, say, the NFS protocol).

I'm happy to write that specification, as long as any contributions
here are unencumbered and acknowledged. In fact, I have been working
on a (so far, flawed) NFS extension:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-nfsv4-integrity-measurement/

Now, for example, the components of a putative Merkle-based IMA
metadata format are all already open:

- The unit size is just an integer

- A certificate fingerprint is a de facto standard, and the
fingerprint digest algorithms are all standardized

- Merkle trees are public domain, I believe, and we're not adding
any special sauce here

- Digital signing algorithms are all standardized

Wondering if we want to hash and save the file's mtime and size too.

We're dealing with an untrusted storage device, and for a remote
filesystem, an untrusted network.

Mimi's earlier point is that any IMA metadata format that involves
unsigned digests is exposed to an alteration attack at rest or in
transit, thus will not provide a robust end-to-end integrity
guarantee.

Therefore, tree root digests must be cryptographically signed to be
properly protected in these environments. Verifying that signature
should be done infrequently relative to reading a file's content.

We assume that storage targets (for block or file) are not trusted.
Therefore storage clients cannot rely on intermediate results (eg,
middle nodes in a Merkle tree) unless those results are generated
within the client's trust envelope.

So: if the storage target is considered inside the client's trust
envelope, it can cache or store durably any intermediate parts of
the verification process. If not, the network and file storage is
considered untrusted, and the client has to rely on nothing but the
signed digest of the tree root.

We could build a scheme around, say, fscache, that might save the
intermediate results durably and locally.

Agreed, these are implementation details. But see above about the
trustworthiness of the intermediate hashes. If they are conveyed
on an untrusted network, then they can't be trusted either.

I imagine it's a common situation where a "yum update" process is
modifying executables while clients are running them. To prevent
a read from pulling refreshed content before the new tree root is
available, it would have to block temporarily until the verification
process succeeds with the updated tree root.
