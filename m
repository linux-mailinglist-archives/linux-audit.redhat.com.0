I'm not disagreeing there has to be a way for the relying party to

Yes, they can ... because supplied nodes can be verified.  That's the
whole point of a merkle tree.  As long as I'm sure of the root hash I
can verify all the rest even if supplied by an untrusted source.  If
you consider a simple merkle tree covering 4 blocks:

       R
     /   \
  H11     H12
  / \     / \
H21 H22 H23 H24
 |    |   |   |
B1   B2  B3  B4

Assume I have the verified root hash R.  If you supply B3 you also
supply H24 and H11 as proof.  I verify by hashing B3 to produce H23
then hash H23 and H24 to produce H12 and if H12 and your supplied H11
hash to R the tree is correct and the B3 you supplied must likewise be
correct.

I agree we want caching on the client, but we can always page in from
the remote as long as we page enough to verify up to R, so we're always
sure the remote supplied genuine information.

Yes, they can, provided enough of them are asked for to verify.  If you
look at the simple example above, suppose I have cached H11 and H12,
but I've lost the entire H2X layer.  I want to verify B3 so I also ask
you for your copy of H24.  Then I generate H23 from B3 and Hash H23 and
H24.  If this doesn't hash to H12 I know either you supplied me the
wrong block or lied about H24.  However, if it all hashes correctly I
know you supplied me with both the correct B3 and the correct H24.

No ... it's not.  Yum specifically worries about that today because if
you update running binaries, it causes a crash.  Yum constructs the
entire new file then atomically links it into place and deletes the old
inode to prevent these crashes.  It never allows you to get into the
situation where you can execute something that will be modified. 
That's also why you have to restart stuff after a yum update because if
you didn't it would still be attached to the deleted inode.
