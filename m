What I was implying is that clients can't trust intermediate Merkle
tree content that is not also signed. So far we are talking about
signing only the tree root.

The storage server can store the tree durably, but if the intermediate
parts of the tree are not signed, the client has to verify them anyway,
and that reduces the value of storing potentially large data structures.

To be clear, my concern is about how much of the tree might be stored
in a Merkle-based metadata format. I just don't see that it has much
value to store more than the signed tree root, because the client will
have to reconstitute or verify some tree contents on most every read.

For sufficiently large files, the tree itself can be larger than what
can be stored in an xattr. This is the same problem that fs-verity
faces. And, as I stated earlier, xattr objects are read in their
entirety, they can't be seeked into or read piecemeal.

What it seemed to me that you were suggesting was an offloaded cache
of the Merkle tree. Either the whole tree is stored on the storage
server, or the storage server provides a service that reconstitutes
that tree on behalf of clients. (Please correct me if I misunderstood).
I just don't think that will be practicable or provide the kind of
benefit you might want.

OK, let's focus on where the tree comes from. It is certainly
possible to build protocol to exchange parts of a Merkle tree. The
question is how it might be stored on the server. There are some
underlying assumptions about the metadata storage mechanism that
should be stated up front.

Current forms of IMA metadata are limited in size and stored in a
container that is read and written in a single operation. If we stick
with that container format, I don't see a way to store a Merkle tree
in there for all file sizes.

Thus it seems to me that we cannot begin to consider the tree-on-the-
server model unless there is a proposed storage mechanism for that
whole tree. Otherwise, the client must have the primary role in
unpacking and verifying the tree.

Storing only the tree root in the metadata means the metadata format
is nicely bounded in size.

Sure.
