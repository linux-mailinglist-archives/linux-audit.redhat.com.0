I don't understand what you mean by GPL encumbered formats.  The GPL is
a code licence not a data or document licence.  The way the spec
process works in Linux is that we implement or evolve a data format
under a GPL implementaiton, but that implementation doesn't implicate
the later standardisation of the data format and people are free to
reimplement under any licence they choose.

Well you wouldn't store the tree would you, just the head hash.  The
rest of the tree can be derived from the data.  You need to distinguish
between what you *must* have to verify integrity (the head hash,
possibly signed) and what is nice to have to speed up the verification
process.  The choice for the latter is cache or reconstruct depending
on the resources available.  If the tree gets cached on the server,
that would be a server implementation detail invisible to the client.

Right that's the integrity data you must have.

Whether it's reconstructed or cached can be an implementation detail. 
You clearly have to reconstruct once, but whether you have to do it
again depends on the memory available for caching and all the other
resource calls in the system.

Right, but I think that's implementation detail.  Probably what we need
is a way to get the log(N) verification hashes from the server and it's
up to the client whether it caches them or not.

For IMA, if you write to a checked file, it gets rechecked the next
time the gate (open/exec/mmap) is triggered.  This means you must
complete the update and have the new integrity data in-place before
triggering the check.  I think this could apply equally to a merkel
tree based system.  It's a sort of Doctor, Doctor it hurts when I do
this situation.
