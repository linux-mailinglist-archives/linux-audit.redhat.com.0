You implied the server can't be trusted to generate the merkel tree. 
I'm showing above it can because of the tree path based verification.

I'm not making any claim about server caching, I'm just saying the
client can request pieces of the tree from the server without having to
reconstruct the whole thing itself because it can verify their
correctness.

And my point isn't about caching, it's about where the tree comes from.
 I claim and you agree the client can get the tree from the server a
piece at a time (because it can path verify it) and doesn't have to
generate it itself.  How much of the tree the client has to store and
whether the server caches, reads it in from somewhere or reconstructs
it is an implementation detail.
